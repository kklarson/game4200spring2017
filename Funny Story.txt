I'm warning you now, but this story isn't the most school-friendly, BUT it is the only funny story
I can think of right now so I apologize in advance.
Once, when I was in 12th grade, my english teacher had every student write about their biggest fear
which impacted their day-to-day lives.  He told us to get as detailed as we wanted, and that
we could simply write "Do not read" at the top if we did not want our stories shared with the class
the following day.  Consequently, everyone wrote about their biggest fears, regardless of how
irrational or embarrassing they might have been, as they knew that they would not be shared with
the rest of the class if they just wrote "Do not read" at the top.  Of course, and I'm sure you
know where this is going, the next day of class was an interesting one...  The teacher showed up
and is holding the stack of papers from the previous school day.  Immediately he began saying how
bizarre and weird all of our essays were and that he had to read some of them.  He proceeds to
start reading my essay which had a nice, big "DO NOT READ" plastered across the top margin.
Fortunately for me, everyone found out that day that I had a fear of using public bathrooms...
I say fortunately for me, because that day, the teacher also read about how the girl sitting next to
me was scared that her friends would find out that she drank her own urine for money earlier
that year...  
So in the end, I got off pretty easy.
